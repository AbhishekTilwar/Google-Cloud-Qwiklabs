Task 1: Create a dataset to store your machine learning models
Letâ€™s just call it "bike"



Task 2: Create a forecasting BigQuery machine learning model

-> NOTE: Just Run the below code it's okay if there is an error. Continue with other commands
    
    
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL bike.location_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    duration_minutes
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
ON
    trips.start_station_name = stations.name
WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
    AND duration_minutes > 0
    
    
    
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL bike.location_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    location,
    duration_minutes
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
ON
    trips.start_station_name = stations.name
WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
    AND duration_minutes > 0
    
    
    
Task 3: Create the second machine learning model

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL bike.subscriber_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018



Task 4: Evaluate the two machine learning models

SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse,
  mean_absolute_error
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL bike.location_model, (
  SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    duration_minutes
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
  JOIN
   `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
  ON
    trips.start_station_name = stations.name
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019)
)




SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse,
  mean_absolute_error
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL bike.subscriber_model, (
  SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019)
)




Task 5: Use the subscriber type machine learning model to predict average trip durations

SELECT
  start_station_name,
  COUNT(*) AS trips
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019
GROUP BY
  start_station_name
ORDER BY
  trips DESC
  
  
  
  SELECT AVG(predicted_duration_minutes) AS average_predicted_trip_length
FROM ML.predict(MODEL bike.subscriber_model, (
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019
  AND subscriber_type = 'Single Trip'
  AND start_station_name = '21st & Speedway @PCL'))
